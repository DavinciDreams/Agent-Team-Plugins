# Marketing Conventions

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Voice Attributes
- **Professional yet Approachable**: Balance expertise with accessibility
- **Authentic and Transparent**: Build trust through honesty
- **Empathetic and Understanding**: Connect with audience needs
- **Confident but Humble**: Show expertise without arrogance

### Tone Spectrum
| Situation | Tone |
|-----------|------|
| Educational content | Informative, patient, clear |
| Product announcements | Excited, confident, urgent |
| Problem-solving | Empathetic, reassuring, solution-oriented |
| Industry insights | Authoritative, analytical, forward-thinking |
| Community engagement | Warm, appreciative, conversational |

### Language Style
- Use active voice for clarity and impact
- Write in second person ("you") to address the reader directly
- Avoid jargon unless explaining technical concepts
- Use contractions for conversational feel (don't, can't, you'll)
- Keep sentences relatively short (15-20 words average)
- Use power words strategically to drive action

## Style Guide

### Formatting Standards
- **Headings**: Use sentence case for H1, H2, H3
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for non-sequential items, numbered for steps
- **Emphasis**: Use bold sparingly for key points, italics for terms
- **Links**: Use descriptive anchor text, not "click here"
- **Quotes**: Use blockquotes for testimonials or important statements

### Punctuation Rules
- **Oxford Comma**: Use before "and" in lists of three or more
- **Em Dashes**: Use with spaces on both sides for breaks — like this
- **En Dashes**: Use for ranges (2020–2025)
- **Exclamation Points**: Use sparingly, max one per paragraph
- **Question Marks**: Use for rhetorical questions sparingly

### Capitalization
- **Title Case**: Use for blog post titles and page headings
- **Sentence Case**: Use for subheadings and body content
- **Proper Nouns**: Always capitalize brand names, product names, trademarks
- **Job Titles**: Capitalize when preceding a name, lowercase otherwise

## Tone and Messaging

### Core Messages
- **Value Proposition**: What makes your offering unique
- **Problem-Solution**: How you address customer pain points
- **Social Proof**: Evidence from customers and industry
- **Call-to-Action**: Clear next steps for the audience

### Messaging Framework
1. **Hook**: Grab attention with a compelling opening
2. **Problem**: Identify the audience's challenge
3. **Solution**: Present your offering as the answer
4. **Proof**: Support with evidence and examples
5. **Action**: Guide to the next step

### Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Focus on benefits, not features | List technical specs without context |
| Use specific numbers and data | Make vague claims like "best in class" |
| Tell stories and use examples | Use empty marketing buzzwords |
| Address objections proactively | Ignore potential concerns |
| Keep promises realistic | Overpromise and underdeliver |

## Visual Identity

### Color Usage
- **Primary Colors**: Use for branding elements, CTAs, and key highlights
- **Secondary Colors**: Use for supporting elements and variety
- **Neutral Colors**: Use for backgrounds, text, and balance
- **Accessibility**: Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text

### Typography
- **Headings**: Use bold, larger fonts for hierarchy
- **Body Text**: Use readable, clean fonts at appropriate sizes (16px minimum)
- **Accent Text**: Use italics or different color for emphasis
- **Consistency**: Use same fonts across all content

### Image Guidelines
- **Quality**: Use high-resolution images (minimum 1200px wide)
- **Relevance**: Ensure images directly support the content
- **Branding**: Include subtle brand elements when appropriate
- **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility
- **Rights**: Use only licensed or original imagery

### Brand Elements
- **Logo**: Use consistent logo placement and sizing
- **Tagline**: Include tagline in key brand touchpoints

# __TEAM__ Team Conventions

## Code Style
- Follow existing project conventions discovered during the discovery phase
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Keep functions focused and small

## Collaboration
- Each agent works within their defined scope
- Agents should not modify files outside their responsibility without coordination
- All changes must follow patterns found in the existing codebase

## Quality Standards
- All new code must have corresponding tests
- Error handling must be explicit, not swallowed
- No hard-coded values - use configuration

## Communication
- Agents report back with specific file:line references
- Include rationale for non-obvious decisions
- Flag risks and potential conflicts early

# Vulnerability Scanning

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

### SAST Overview

SAST analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries without executing the application to identify security vulnerabilities.

### SAST Techniques

- **Pattern Matching**: Match code against known vulnerability patterns
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Track data flow through the application to identify tainted data
- **Control Flow Analysis**: Analyze execution paths to identify potential issues
- **Taint Analysis**: Track user input through the application to identify injection points
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understand code semantics to identify complex vulnerabilities

### Common SAST Vulnerabilities

- **Injection Flaws**: SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS
- **Authentication Issues**: Weak authentication, session management flaws
- **Authorization Issues**: Broken access controls, privilege escalation
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak algorithms, improper key management
- **Input Validation**: Missing or insufficient input validation
- **Error Handling**: Information leakage through error messages

## Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

### DAST Overview

DAST analyzes running applications to identify security vulnerabilities through external testing.

### DAST Techniques

- **Crawling and Spidering**: Discover application endpoints and functionality
- **Fuzzing**: Send malformed or unexpected input to identify vulnerabilities
- **Authentication Testing**: Test authentication mechanisms for weaknesses
- **Session Management**: Analyze session handling for security issues
- **Input Validation**: Test input fields for injection vulnerabilities
- **Business Logic**: Test business logic flaws and authorization bypasses

### Common DAST Vulnerabilities

- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS
- **Authentication Flaws**: Weak passwords, session fixation
- **Authorization Issues**: IDOR, privilege escalation
- **Session Management**: Session hijacking, fixation
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak SSL/TLS, insecure cookies
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data in responses, error messages

## Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

### SCA Overview

SCA identifies and analyzes third-party components and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

### SCA Techniques

- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify all direct and transitive dependencies
- **Vulnerability Matching**: Match dependencies against vulnerability databases
- **License Compliance**: Check for license compliance issues
- **Version Analysis**: Track dependency versions and updates
- **Risk Scoring**: Assess risk based on vulnerability severity and usage

### SCA Vulnerability Databases

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: Standardized vulnerability identifiers
- **GitHub Advisory Database**: GitHub's vulnerability database
- **Snyk Vulnerability Database**: Snyk's curated vulnerability database
- **OSS Index**: Sonatype's open-source vulnerability database

## Container Security Scanning

### Container Vulnerabilities

- **Base Image Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities in the base OS image
- **Application Dependencies**: Vulnerabilities in application dependencies
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure container configurations
- **Secrets in Images**: Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Outdated Packages**: Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities

### Container Security Best Practices

- **Use Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images like Alpine or distroless
- **Scan Images**: Scan images at build time and runtime
- **Patch Regularly**: Keep base images and dependencies updated
- **Scan Dependencies**: Include SCA for application dependencies
- **Run as Non-Root**: Run containers as non-root users
- **Read-Only Filesystems**: Use read-only filesystems where possible
- **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits to prevent DoS

## Dependency Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Management Strategies

- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to latest secure versions
- **Automated Scanning**: Integrate SCA into CI/CD pipelines
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities
- **Version Pinning**: Pin specific versions to prevent unexpected updates
- **Lock Files**: Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verify package integrity and provenance

### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

- **What is SBOM**: Formal inventory of software components and dependencies
- **SBOM Formats**: SPDX, CycloneDX, SWID tags
- **SBOM Benefits**: Vulnerability tracking, license compliance, supply chain security
